        <h3>Portfolio of Zhamilya</h3>
        <span> The very first assignment </span>
        <p> As part of the Interactive Mobile and Web Application Development course, we need to complete Assignment 1:
            Foundational Web Interface Development. The task is to design and implement a personal portfolio website as
            a single-page application (SPA) using HTML5, CSS3, and vanilla JavaScript. The website should be responsive,
            include ‚ÄúAbout Me‚Äù, ‚ÄúProjects‚Äù, and ‚ÄúContact‚Äù sections, feature JavaScript-driven interactivity (e.g.,
            dark/light mode toggle or form validation), and follow semantic HTML and consistent styling practices. </p>

            <h3>Hi, I am Zhamilya!</h3>
            <br> <br>
            <p>I am a fourth-year student at KBTU, majoring in IT Management. I spent one semester in France as part of
                an academic mobility program, which gave me valuable international experience and broadened my
                perspective. I am a graduate of IQanat High School of Burabay. My main professional interests lie in
                analytics and IT auditing, and I am eager to develop my expertise further in these areas. Also lately I
                am really into cybersecurity and writing this project right on the conference called "KazHackStan" by
                TSARKA.</p>
            </p>
            <br> <br>
            <p>I know a little bit of C, C++, Python and Go!</p>
            <br> <br>
            <p>I hope to get 95+ at the end of this course. Please.</p>

        <div class="project-card">
            <h3>MY_LS</h3>
            <p>I reimplemented the ls command in C. The project involved reading directories, handling file paths, and
                displaying file information in different formats. It gave me practical experience with system calls,
                directory traversal, and string formatting./p>
        </div>
        <div class="project-card">
            <h3>MY_TOP</h3>
            <p>I created a simplified version of the top command. It required retrieving process information, updating
                it in real time, and presenting it in a clear layout. Through this, I gained insights into process
                monitoring, memory usage, and performance statistics.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="project-card">
            <h3>MY_SUDO</h3>
            <p>I developed a minimal version of sudo, focusing on permission handling and privilege escalation. This
                project improved my understanding of user authentication, system security concepts, and access control.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="project-card">
            <h3>MY_HUNTER A.K.A DUCK HUNT</h3>
            <p>A remake of the classic Duck Hunt game written in C. Focused on handling user input, event-driven
                programming, and collision detection within a continuous game loop./p>
        </div>
        <div class="project-card">
            <h3>MY_RADAR</h3>
            <p>Developed a radar simulation where radars detect airplanes within a base radius. Airplanes inside the
                safe zone avoid collisions, while those outside may collide and be destroyed. Practiced real-time object
                tracking and collision handling logic.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="project-card">
            <h3>SETTING_UP</h3>
            <p>Built a program that generates a map with obstacles and finds the largest possible square that fits
                without overlap. Strengthened algorithmic problem-solving skills and 2D array manipulation.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="project-card">
            <h3>ORGANIZED</h3>
            <p>Created a data management program with functions like add, delete, and sort, implemented using linked
                lists. Improved knowledge of data structures, dynamic memory allocation, and pointer operations in C.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="project-card">
            <h3>SECURED</h3>
            <p>Implemented a hashing utility that stores words in a table for retrieval. This project introduced me to
                hash functions, hash tables, and efficient storage techniques for quick access.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="project-card">
            <h3>MY_PRINTF</h3>
            <p>I reimplemented the printf function in C. It required parsing format specifiers, managing variable
                arguments, and producing correctly formatted output. This helped me strengthen my knowledge of variadic
                functions, memory management, and string manipulation.</p>
